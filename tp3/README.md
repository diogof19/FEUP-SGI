## Project information

- Strong points:
  - We implemented all of the required functionalities, with the rules in accordance with the ones given to us;
  - Aside from what was required, we implemented a 'Redo' button.
- Scene:
  - We implemented three scenes: one with the Eye of Sauron, the tower beneath it, and an encampment on the side, just like we had before ([scene](scenes/barad-dur.xml)); another with a space theme, with the inside of a spaceship ([scene](scenes/space.xml)); and lastly, a scene with a prison ([scene](scenes/prison.xml));
  - The scene screenshots are in the [images](doc/images/) folder.
